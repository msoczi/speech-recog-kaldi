# Speech Recognition with Kaldi
### Student project for Applications of Machine Learning

The project consists in creating a language model that will recognize example sentences recorded from a microphone.<br>
<br>
The first step was to create a data set. Data concerns the text coverage of Premier League matches and comes from the website www.flashscore.pl. <br>
Data have been pre-cleaned so that it can be used for speech recognition. Based on these text, I recorded 5 statements which then were used in the recognition process. Then I did the recognition and evaluation of the example sentences.
